# 2016-Election-Contribution-Data-
 Performing exploratory data analysis on the FEC data of money exchanged during the 2016 election. I will be looking at the data found at the [FEC website](http://classic.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml#a2015_2016). The specific files that I downloaded were the Committee Master file, Candidate Master file, and Contributions by Individuals. The Contributions by Individuals file is very large and therefore I will be looking specifically at contributions from individuals in Berkeley, CA.   I have two goals for this project.   - Answer questions by computing descriptive statistics on the data - Conduct a hypothesis test  I will complete almost all of this project using SQL. A small portion will rely on the use of pandas dataframes in Python.
